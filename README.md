# About

This is a project to demonstrate how to use the [RadaeePDF Cordova Plugin] in an Ionic application.

# Quick Start

To run this you'll need NodeJS and NPM. It's recommended to use NVM. There is an `.nvmrc` file to suggest the Node version used to create the project â€“ v8.11.1.

You'll need some global dependencies if you don't yet have them:

```bash
npm install -g ionic cordova
```

Then install package dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

Running on Android with Live Reload:
```bash
ionic cordova run android -lr
```

Running on iOS is a bit more complex. Please follow the [Ionic Deployment guide](https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/deploying/).
